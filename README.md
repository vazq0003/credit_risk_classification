# credit_risk_classification
This is my Module 20 Challenge submission
In this challenge I used python to predict loan status using logistic regression.

Data Preparation
-
-Read the lending data from "lending_data.csv."
-Create labels (loan status) and features from the dataset.
-Split the data into training and testing sets.

Logistic Regression Model 
-
-Fit a logistic regression model using the training data.
-Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

Logistic Regression Model (Resampled Data)
-
-Resample the training data using RandomOverSampler.
-Fit a logistic regression model using the resampled training data.
-Evaluate the model's performance on the resampled data.
